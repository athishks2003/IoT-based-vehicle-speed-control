We built a speed detection system for vehicles using transmitters and recievers (LoRa) which reduces the cost of fitting the Speed detection camera. the concept behind the operation is The transmitter module is fitted on the speed limit boards
and these transmitter constantly transmit the speed limit information of the particular area to the moving vehicles and where the moving vehicles are fitted with the LoRa reciever which is integrated with the micro controller 
which process and gets the current speed of the vehicle through the vehicle's speedometer and compares with recieved speed limit of the area and if the vehicle is overspeeding then the driver is alerted with the warning message and if the 
driver is overspeeding again then the respective vehicle registration number fixed at the start up configuration which is non-modifiable is uploaded in the cloud with the overspeed details for the issue of Fine.
